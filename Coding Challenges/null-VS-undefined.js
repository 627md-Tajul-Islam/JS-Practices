// let js; declare a variable without value.it will be undefined.
// you must return results otherwise it will be undefined 
// after writing return.you must write where you are returning it.
// you must declare value of parameters ,otherwise it will be undefined
// if the property is not in the object,it will be undefined
// let fun = undefined; if the value is set to undefined
// undefined is falsy

let tj = undefined;
console.log(fun);

//null means empty

// undefined is one kind of error,it means when we make some mistakes in our code.it will undefined. but null can be set as a value,and the value is empty
